# Passart <sup>2</sup> : Secure passwords and sensitive documents in Art!
*Pronounced*: __"passart-squared"__<br>
* Algorithm encodes any text input, such as passwords or other sensitive documents using a random encoding scheme each time the program is run.
* Each word is then mapped to an RGB color, thus allowing for the creation of a colorful patchwork of art, __shown below.__
* A companion tool allows users to easily recover their passwords and documents.

### A password is encrypted in the image below:

## Next Steps
* Develop a website to easily secure & recover passwords.
* Venture into other "dimensions", perhaps:
  * Passart-Pi: Circles
  * Passart <sup>3</sup>: 3-dimensional cubes
  * Passart
